      <p>We set out in 2010 to make a coffee shop unlike any other. Instead of asking for tips to pay our baristas, we
        wanted to accept donations to help out charities that we were passionate about. Instead of gouging customers
        just
        to pad our pockets, we wanted to charge a fair price and donate a portion of the sale to those same charities.
        We
        wanted people to get passionate again about coffee, get passionate about people.</p>

      <h2>Please Donate</h2>
      <p>Proceeds from the sale of our coffee go to charity but if you feel the need to donate as well please feel free
        to
        do so at any of our locations. Our staff are knowledgeable about several local charities and are happy to assist
        you in finding one that aligns with your personal values.</p>
