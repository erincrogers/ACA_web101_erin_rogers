      <p>“People are more aware of sustainability issues with coffee because, you know, this isn’t food,” says Kim Elena
        Ionescu, the director of sustainability for the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) and a former
        coffee
        buyer for renowned North Carolina-based roaster Counter Culture Coffee. “It’s non-nutritive, not something you
        need
        for survival. This is something that we consume for pleasure.” Because of its status as a sort of luxury or
        specialty item, unlike, say, eggs, coffee consumers have the ability to demand more from their coffee producers
        than
        simply low prices.

        And that’s important, because coffee farmers are among the worst-treated in the world. Largely coming from
        developing nations in Central America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, coffee farmers are faced with
        legendarily
        hard work, low prices, and a crop that’s subject to rampant price pressures as well as various forms of blight
        and
        disease.

        Coffee farmers are among the worst-treated in the world.

        There are some forces working to make things better for coffee farmers, and some of those are quantified with
        various labels, slogans, and certifications. But it can be hard to figure out what to trust and what to look
        for;
        some nice-sounding phrases turn out to be legally meaningless, and some really great certifications are saddled
        with
        terrible names that undersell their value. Ionescu led us through how to buy coffee in a way that ensures, to
        the
        best of your ability, that farmers are being paid and treated fairly.

        This isn’t a perfect guide; coffee, like any other product grown in a developing country and destined for a
        developed country, has a long ways to go before the various certifications and regulations really provide good
        working conditions and wages to the producers. But that shouldn’t stop you from trying. It’s not every product
        that
        allows you to act ethically every single morning.</p>

    <img src="./articleMedia/coffeeArticle2.jpeg" <h2>The Price Difference</h2>
    <div class="ptext">
      <p>Coffee price is absurdly variable: A mass-market coffee like Folgers or Maxwell House can cost about $5 per
        pound,
        while ultra-rare coffees, like Black Ivory Coffee (made from coffee that’s passed through the intestinal system
        of
        elephants) can run up to hundreds of dollars per pound. More common “expensive” coffees, roasted by companies
        like
        Counter Culture, Stumptown, and Blue Bottle, often cost around $20-$29 per pound.

        It would be easy to assume that more expensive coffees would pass some of that premium on over to the farmers,
        but
        that’s not always the case. “You can’t necessarily assume that a high price means good working conditions, or
        that
        by paying a high price you’re paying for environmental sustainability, unless that is explicit,” says Ionescu.
        “I
        think you can make the assumption that if your coffee is cheap, the environmental and working conditions are
        probably not good.”

        In other words, you have to dig a little deeper than just the price tag. You want to make sure it’s the farmers
        who
        are paid well, not the retailer or roaster.</p>
